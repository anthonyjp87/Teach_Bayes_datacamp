These are my notes from the intro to Bayes from the Data Camp website. 

The cool thing about this course is definitely the r-package, TeachBayes. This has a few interesting functions. 

Bayes Crank == calculates posterior from Prior/Likelihood

normal update ==Calculating Posterior from Continuous normal proir

Beta Select==this one is really cool. Given a normal curve it defines the a & b of a beta curve for two given quantiles/x's.
