These are my notes from the intro to Bayes from the Data Camp website. 

The cool thing about this course is definitely the r-package, TeachBayes. This has a few interesting functions. 

Bayes Crank == calculates posterior from Prior/Likelihood

normal update ==Calculating Posterior from Continuous normal proir

Beta Select==this one is really cool. Given a normal curve it defines the a & b of a beta curve for two given quantiles/x's. 


Many thanks to Prof. Jim Albert whose lectures are online. 

As far as the course goes: I would really appreciate some written material on this course. A few video lectures and some 'plug and chug R code may be enough to get me to 'pass the course', but it isn't enough for me to really understand the concepts. I think it would be helpful to have as a reference. I also don't really like using the embedded editor instead of the R program as it is difficult for me to capture notes. (I have to open R in the background, use the helpfiles from R and capture notes in my R editor instead of the online embedded R)
